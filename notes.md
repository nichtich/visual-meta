# Visual-Meta data format

This document discusses specification of a data format for [Visual-Meta](http://wordpress.liquid.info/06/visual-meta/).

## What is Visual-Meta?

Visual-Meta is an approach to make documentâ€™s metadata machine and human readable. It is developed by Frode Hegland as part of is PhD.

The basic idea is to add metadata as appendix to the end of a document.

## Related data formats

* _Internal Metadata_: Several document formats (EXIF, PDF...) support to store metadata as part of a document but this data is not visible.
* _YAML-Header_: Document formats such as [R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/markdown-document.html) and [Pandoc Markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-yaml_metadata_block) support metadata in YAML format in front of a document. As long as the document is processed in source format, this is visual metadata but the documents are mainly used as source to create other document formats.

## Requirements

The format should be 

1. _human-readable_. This forbids binary formats such as list of hexadecimal digits or QR-Codes.

2. _machine-readable_. Therefore

    2.1. The metadata section must be automatically be separable from the rest of the document.    
    2.2. The format must formally be specified

3. _hackable_ for easy creation, extraction, and processing. This means:

    3.1. The format should be based on commons standards as much as possible
    
    3.2. The format should not require complex parsing and encoding rules

4. _condense_ to not take too much space. One feature derived from this requirements is the format should not depend on newlines and allow line wrapping.

## Data modeling

Every data format is the product of an (possibly implicit) data modeling process from

A) a conceptual model (which information should be transfered)

B) a serialization format (e.g. JSON, YAML, CSV, XML, RDF...)

D) an encoding (how to use the serialization format, e.g. which fields in which order etc.)
