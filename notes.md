# Visual-Meta data format

This document discusses specification of a data format for [Visual-Meta](http://wordpress.liquid.info/06/visual-meta/).

## What is Visual-Meta?

Visual-Meta is an approach to make documentâ€™s metadata machine and human readable. It is developed by Frode Hegland as part of is PhD.

The basic idea is to add metadata as appendix to the end of a document.

## Related data formats

* _Internal Metadata_: Several document formats (EXIF, PDF...) support to store metadata as part of a document but this data is not visible.
* _YAML-Header_: Document formats such as [R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/markdown-document.html) and [Pandoc Markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-yaml_metadata_block) support metadata in YAML format in front of a document. As long as the document is processed in source format, this is visual metadata but the documents are mainly used as source to create other document formats.

## Requirements

The format should be 

1. _human-readable_
2 _machine-readable_
3. _hackable_ for easy creation, extraction, and processing
4. _condense_ to not take too much space
